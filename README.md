## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this exercise is to use the knowledge we have gained thru the module and apply it to extract temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. 

## Key differences in weather in Oahu
- The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degrees F, 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.
  - This represents a -5% change in average temperature from June to December
- The frequency of temperatures recorded in June tends to have a much more normal, cooroborated by the smaller std measure of June temps vs December temps
- The December temperatures seem to vary more than those in June given its larger range in recorded temperatures (comparing the max vs min temp of each month)
  - When we compare the distribution of Dec Temps, we can see that the median temperature in Dec is more inline with the average, and there are not many outliers skuing the average temperature higher or lower than the actual recorded frequency.

## Summary
My finding is although December seems to vary more than those of June, it still would provide appropriate weather conditions for both surfing and demand in ice cream. The average temperatures in June and December only differ by 4 degrees. From the December histogram, we can see its median temperature, with the highest frequency recorded across a span of years, is about 72 degrees. 

Overall the weather in December and June are historically very similar, Oahu seems to be the perfect location for the surf and ice cream shop.
